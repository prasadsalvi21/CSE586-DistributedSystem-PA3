In this assignment, you will design a simple DHT based on Chord. Although the design is based
on Chord, it is a simplified version of Chord; you do not need to implement finger tables and
finger-based routing; you also do not need to handle node leaves/failures.Therefore, there are
three things you need to implement: 1) ID space partitioning/re-partitioning, 2) Ring-based
routing, and 3) Node joins.
